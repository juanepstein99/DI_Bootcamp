suggestions for improvement:
- Consider implementing the `add_animal` method with `**kwargs` as suggested in Step 8 to enhance its flexibility.
- Add documentation strings (docstrings) to each method to explain its purpose and usage. This greatly improves readability and maintainability.
- Use `f-strings` for cleaner and more readable string formatting.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the `Farm` class with the `__init__`, `add_animal`, `get_info`, `get_animal_types`, and `get_short_info` methods as described in the instructions. The output matches the example, and all steps are correctly implemented, except for the bonus to upgrade the add_animal method. Therefore, the correctness is 90%.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is properly indented. Readability is 90%.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well for the given problem size. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks. Performance is 90%.
- security: The code does not involve any external input or operations that could pose security risks. Security is 100%.
