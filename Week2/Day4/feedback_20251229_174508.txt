Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses both challenges, sorting comma-separated words alphabetically and finding the longest word in a sentence, as described in the instructions. All steps are implemented correctly, and the code produces the expected outputs for the provided examples.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear comments explaining each step of the process. Variable names are descriptive, enhancing readability.
- performance: The code demonstrates good performance, utilizing built-in Python functions like `split()`, `sorted()`, `len()`, and `join()` efficiently. The solutions have a time complexity of O(n log n) for sorting (Challenge 1) and O(n) for finding the longest word (Challenge 2).
- security: The code has no apparent security vulnerabilities. It uses standard input and string operations without external dependencies or risks of injection.
