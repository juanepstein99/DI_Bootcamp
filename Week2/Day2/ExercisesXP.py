# 🌟 Exercise 1: What Are You Learning?
# Goal: Create a function that displays a message about what you’re learning.

# Step 1: Define a Function
# Define a function named display_message().
# This function should not take any parameters.

# Step 2: Print a Message
# For example: “I am learning about functions in Python.”

# Step 3: Call the Function
# This will execute the code inside the function and print your message.

# Expected Output:
# I am learning about functions in Python.

def display_message():                                      # Step 1: Define a Function
    print("I am learning about functions in Python.")       # Step 2: Print a Message
display_message()                                           # Step 3: Call the Function



# 🌟 Exercise 2: What’s Your Favorite Book?
# Goal: Create a function that displays a message about a favorite book.

# Step 1: Define a Function with a Parameter
# Define a function named favorite_book().
# This function should accept one parameter called title.

# Step 2: Print a Message with the Title
# The function needs to output a message like “One of my favorite books is <title>”.

# Step 3: Call the Function with an Argument
# Call the favorite_book() function and provide a book title as an argument.
# For example: favorite_book("Alice in Wonderland").

def favorite_book(title):                               # Step 1: Define a Function with a Parameter
    print(f"One of my favorite books is {title}")       
                                                        # Step 2: Print a Message with the Title
favorite_book("Title")
favorite_book("The bible")                              # Step 3: Call the Function with an Argument

# 🌟 Exercise 3: Some Geography
# Goal: Create a function that describes a city and its country.

# Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters ok
# Define a function named describe_city().
# This function should accept two parameters: city and country.
# Give the country parameter a default value, such as “Unknown”.

# Step 2: Print a Message
# Inside the function, set up the code to display a sentence like “ is in “.
# Replace <city> and <country> with the parameter values.

# Step 3: Call the Function
# Call the describe_city() function with different city and country combinations.
# Try calling it with and without providing the country argument to see the default value in action.
# Example: describe_city("Reykjavik", "Iceland") and describe_city("Paris").

def describe_city (city, country = "Unknown"):        # Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters ok
    print(f"{city} is in {country}")                  # Step 2: Print a Message

describe_city("Resistencia", "Argentina")             # Call the describe_city() function with different city and country combinations.
describe_city("Quitilipi")                          # Try calling it with and without providing the country argument to see the default value in action.

# Exercise 4: Random
# Goal: Create a function that generates random numbers and compares them.

# At the beginning of your script, use import random to access the random number generation functions.

# Step 2: Define a Function with a Parameter
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 as a parameter.

# Step 3: Generate a Random Number
# Inside the function, use random.randint(1, 100) to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.

# Step 4: Compare the Numbers
# If they are the same, print a success message. Otherwise, print a fail message and display both numbers.

# Step 5: Call the Function
# Call the function with a number between 1 and 100.

import random                                                                             # Step 1: Import the random Module

# Define a function called make_shirt().
# This function should accept two parameters: size and text.

# Step 2: Print a Summary Message
# Set up the function to display a sentence summarizing the shirt’s size and message.

# 🌟 Exercise 6: Magicians…
# Goal: Modify a list of magician names and display them in different ways.

# Step 1: Create a List of Magician Names
# Create a list called magician_names with the given names:
# ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

# Step 2: Create a Function to Display Magicians
# Create a function called show_magicians() that takes the magician_names list as a parameter.
# Inside the function, iterate through the list and print each magician’s name.

# Step 3: Create a Function to Modify the List
# Create a function called make_great() that takes the magician_names list as a parameter.
# Inside the function, use a for loop to iterate through the list and add “the Great” before each magician’s name.

# Step 4: Call the Functions
# Call make_great() to modify the list.
# Call show_magicians() to display the modified list.

magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']                # Step 1: Create a List of Magician Names

def show_magicians(magician_names):                                              # Step 2: Create a Function to Display Magicians
    for magician in magician_names:                                              # Inside the function, iterate through the list and print each magician’s name.
        print(magician)

def make_great (magician_names):                                                 # Step 3: Create a Function to Modify the List
    for i in range(len(magician_names)):                                         # Inside the function, use a for loop to iterate through the list and add “the Great” before each magician’s name.
        magician_names[i] = magician_names[i] + " the Great"

# 🌟 Exercise 7: Temperature Advice
# Goal: Generate a random temperature and provide advice based on the temperature range.

# Step 1: Create the get_random_temp() Function
# Create a function called get_random_temp() that returns a random integer between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius.

# Step 2: Create the main() Function
# Create a function called main(). Inside this function:
# Call get_random_temp() to get a random temperature.
# Store the temperature in a variable and print a friendly message like:
# “The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.”

# Step 3: Provide Temperature-Based Advice
# Inside main(), provide advice based on the temperature:
# Below 0°C: e.g., “Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today.”
# Between 0°C and 16°C: e.g., “Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat.”
# Between 16°C and 23°C: e.g., “Nice weather.”
# Between 24°C and 32°C: e.g., “A bit warm, stay hydrated.”
# Between 32°C and 40°C: e.g., “It’s really hot! Stay cool.”

# Step 4: Floating-Point Temperatures (Bonus)
# Modify get_random_temp() to return a random floating-point number using random.uniform() for more accurate temperature values.

# Step 5: Month-Based Seasons (Bonus)
# Instead of directly generating a random temperature, ask the user for a month (1-12) and determine the season using if/elif conditions.
# Modify get_random_temp() to return temperatures specific to each season.

def get_random_temp(month):
    if month in [12, 1, 2]:          # Winter
        return random.uniform(-10, 10)
    elif month in [3, 4, 5]:         # Spring
        return random.uniform(5, 20)
    elif month in [6, 7, 8]:         # Summer
        return random.uniform(20, 40)
    else:                            # Fall
        return random.uniform(10, 25)

def main():
    month = int(input("Enter the month number (1-12): "))
    temp = get_random_temp(month)
    print(f"The temperature right now is {temp:.1f} degrees Celsius.")
    if temp < 0:
        print("Brrr, that is freezing! Wear some extra layers today.")
    elif 0 <= temp <= 16:
        print("Quite chilly! Don not forget your coat.")
    elif 17 <= temp <= 23:
        print("Nice weather.")
    elif 24 <= temp <= 32:
        print("A bit warm, stay hydrated.")
    else:
        print("It is really hot! Stay cool.")
main()
