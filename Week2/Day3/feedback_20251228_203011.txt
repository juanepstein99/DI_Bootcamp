Brief justification:
- correctness: The code perfectly implements the Tic Tac Toe game as described in the problem description. It includes all the required functionalities: displaying the board, getting player input, checking for a win, and managing the main game loop. It directly addresses the problem and implements the functionality explicitly described in the Chapter Content/Questions.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The functions are named descriptively, and comments are used effectively to explain the purpose of each section. The code adheres to good coding practices, making it readable and maintainable.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well for the Tic Tac Toe game. The algorithms used for checking win conditions and tie games are optimal for the size of the board. There are no unnecessary computations or operations that would impact performance.
- security: The code does not involve any external input or potentially vulnerable operations. The player input is validated to ensure it is within the allowed range and that the chosen cell is empty, which mitigates the risk of errors or malicious input.
