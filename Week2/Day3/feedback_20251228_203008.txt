suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding input validation in the switch_player function to ensure only 'X' or 'O' are used as players.
- The code is well-structured and follows the instructions clearly. There are no major areas for improvement.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the functionalities described in the chapter content, including creating the board, displaying it, handling player input with validation, checking for a winner and a tie, and managing the game loop. Each step is correctly implemented as described in the instructions. The code directly and completely addresses the problem of creating a Tic Tac Toe game.
- readability: The code is well-organized and easy to read due to the use of functions for each major step. Variable names are descriptive, and comments explain the purpose of each section. The display_board function provides a clear visual representation of the game board. Minor improvements can include adding comments for the switch_player function.
- performance: The performance is generally good for a simple Tic Tac Toe game. The code is efficient in terms of computational complexity, and there are no obvious bottlenecks. The game runs smoothly and quickly, with no noticeable delays or performance issues. The while loop continues until there is a win or tie and exits gracefully.
- security: The security aspects are minimal since it's a local game. However, the code does include basic input validation to prevent errors caused by invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric input, out-of-range values, or trying to overwrite existing moves). Additional security measures are not necessary for this type of application.
