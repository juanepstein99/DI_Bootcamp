# 🌟 Exercise 1: Converting Lists into Dictionaries
# You are given two lists. 
# Convert them into a dictionary where the first list contains the keys and the second list contains the corresponding values.
# Lists:

keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

Dictionary = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(Dictionary)

# 🌟 Exercise 2: Cinemax #2
# Write a program that calculates the total cost of movie tickets for a family based on their ages.

# Family members’ ages are stored in a dictionary.
# The ticket pricing rules are as follows:
# Under 3 years old: Free
# 3 to 12 years old: $10
# Over 12 years old: $15

# Loop through the family dictionary to calculate the total cost.
# Print the ticket price for each family member.
# Print the total cost at the end.

# Bonus:
# Allow the user to input family members’ names and ages, then calculate the total ticket cost.

#Family data
family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}
total_cost = 0

for name, age in family.items():
    if age < 3:
        price = 0
    elif 3 <= age <= 12:
        price = 10
    else:
        price = 15 
    print(f"{name} ticket price is ${price}")
    total_cost += price

# 🌟 Exercise 3: Zara
# Create and manipulate a dictionary that contains information about the Zara brand.

# Brand Information:
# name: Zara
# creation_date: 1975
# creator_name: Amancio Ortega Gaona
# type_of_clothes: men, women, children, home
# international_competitors: Gap, H&M, Benetton
# number_stores: 7000
# major_color: 
#     France: blue, 
#     Spain: red, 
#     US: pink, green

# Create a dictionary called brand with the provided data.
# Modify and access the dictionary as follows:
# Change the value of number_stores to 2.
# Print a sentence describing Zara’s clients using the type_of_clothes key.
# Add a new key country_creation with the value Spain.
# Check if international_competitors exists and, if so, add “Desigual” to the list.
# Delete the creation_date key.
# Print the last item in international_competitors.
# Print the major colors in the US.
# Print the number of keys in the dictionary.
# Print all keys of the dictionary.

# Bonus:
# Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with creation_date and number_stores. 
# Merge this dictionary with the original brand dictionary and print the result.

# Create a dictionary called brand with the provided data.

# 🌟 Exercise 4: Disney Characters
# You are given a list of Disney characters. Create three dictionaries based on different patterns as shown below:

# Character List:
# users = ["Mickey", "Minnie", "Donald", "Ariel", "Pluto"]

# Expected Results:
# 1. Create a dictionary that maps characters to their indices:
# {"Mickey": 0, "Minnie": 1, "Donald": 2, "Ariel": 3, "Pluto": 4}

# 2. Create a dictionary that maps indices to characters:
# {0: "Mickey", 1: "Minnie", 2: "Donald", 3: "Ariel", 4: "Pluto"}

# 3. Create a dictionary where characters are sorted alphabetically and mapped to their indices:
# {"Ariel": 0, "Donald": 1, "Mickey": 2, "Minnie": 3, "Pluto": 4}

# 1. Create a dictionary that maps characters to their indices:
users = ["Mickey", "Minnie", "Donald", "Ariel", "Pluto"]
disneyusers = {}

for index, name in enumerate(users):
    disneyusers[name] = index
print(disneyusers) 

# 2. Create a dictionary that maps indices to characters:

disneyusers2 = {}
for index, name in enumerate(users): 
    disneyusers2[index] = name
print(disneyusers2)

# 3. Create a dictionary where characters are sorted alphabetically and mapped to their indices:
sorted_users = sorted(users)

disneyusers3 = {}
for index, name in enumerate(sorted_users): 
    disneyusers3[name] = index
print(disneyusers3)
