suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain more complex logic.
- The code is well-structured and easy to follow.
Brief justification:
- correctness: Both challenges are correctly implemented. Challenge 1 accurately creates the letter index dictionary as specified. Challenge 2 correctly identifies affordable items, cleans the data, and sorts the output, adhering to all instructions and examples. The outputs match the expected outputs.
- readability: The code is well-organized and uses meaningful variable names, which enhances readability. The clear separation of the two challenges into sections also improves readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given problem sizes. Using `enumerate` in Challenge 1 is a good performance practice. Cleaning the data is done in a straightforward manner.
- security: The code does not directly involve user input in a way that creates significant security risks. However, it's always good to be mindful of potential vulnerabilities when dealing with external data (e.g., user input in Challenge 1).
