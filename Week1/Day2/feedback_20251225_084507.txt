suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each section, even though the exercise descriptions are included as comments.
- For exercise 3, instead of including the error, you could provide a comment explaining why the error occurs (type mismatch).
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are correctly implemented according to the instructions. The code addresses each task, demonstrating understanding of print statements, variables, mathematical operations, comparison operators, if statements, and user input, as outlined in the chapter content.
- readability: The code is generally readable due to the clear variable names and straightforward logic. However, adding more comments could further improve readability.
- performance: The code is performant, using simple operations and efficient data structures. No performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code is secure as it doesn't involve any external data sources or sensitive operations. The user input is used safely in the context of the exercises.
