suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain more complex logic, enhancing readability for others.
- In exercise 1, while `update` works, consider using `my_fav_numbers.add()` for adding single elements to improve clarity.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately and completely solves all the problems and implements the functionality described in each exercise of the chapter content. Each exercise is correctly addressed, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topics. The bonus section of exercise 9 is also correctly implemented.
- readability: The code is generally well-formatted and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive. The comments are useful in understanding the code's purpose.
- performance: The code is efficient and uses appropriate data structures and algorithms for each task. The solutions are optimized for the given constraints.
- security: The code uses appropriate input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. For example, in Exercise 6, the input name is checked to ensure that it contains only letters and is at least 3 letters long. Input is casted to integer when needed.
